Description:
Say you are on a deserted driving and you encounter an accident, what is your first reflex, calling the ambulance or the police with the Fire Station as required. As the accident instance, itself it does not warrant the victim to be able to alert support on its own. Therefore we have introduced a mobile phone application for you to report in just a fraction of seconds.

Nowadays everyoneâ€™s phone has inbuilt Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensors. Using these sensors if a vehicle is in motion and suddenly encounters an accident there will be a sudden drop in speed accounted by the Accelerometer, and an immediate impact documented by the Gyroscope. If these 2 information cross a threshold decided, the application will send SOS signals to the 3 respective divisions i.e. Hospitals/Police Station/Fire Station as per the requirement on site. And your help will be there in just no time.

Even though our plans were gigantic but our knowledge was competitively not much. 
Hence we had to compromise on our idea and what we have made is an application where all you got to do is. Open your app, choose the option of whether you want to help for yourself or someone else. And at last, fill up a short form. When you submit it, the information provided by you will be provided to the 3 respective divisions i.e. Hospitals/Police Station/Fire Station as per the on-site requirement. And your help will be there in a while.
